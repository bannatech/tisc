-----------------------------------------------------------------------<--------
  The Architecture of TISC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<--------

The basic architecture of TISC resembles a Von-Neumann architecture with a an 8-bit
address space and an 8-bit word. The execution of instructions and input data is
conditionally sourced from external input or internal RAM. Internally the data loop
has two primary busses: Register Input bus, and the ALU Output bus.

There are a total of 10 busses with 7 distinct busses which compose to allow data
to move through the architecture.

The 7 distinct data busses (in no particular order) are as follows:

0* ALU Output Bus
1* Stack Output Bus
2* Immediate Bus
3* Program Counter Output Bus
4* Memory Pointer Bus
5* Memory Output Bus
6* External Input Bus

The 3 multiplexed data busses are as follows:

7* The Register Input bus is multiplexed from 4 busses:
 0* ALU Output Bus
 1* Stack Output Bus
 2* Immediate Bus
 9* Internal Input Bus

8* The Address Bus is multiplexed from 2 busses:
 3* Program Counter Output Bus
 4* Memory Pointer Bus

9* The Internal Input Bus is multiplexed from 2 busses:
 5* Memory Output Bus
 6* External Input Bus

These multiplexed busses support the modularity of the system to implement external
instruction memory and external memory mapped components to extend the capacity of
a TISC core by controlling the source of each multiplexed bus.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------<--------
    External Interface
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<--------

TISC is structured to be exensible through I/O context and persisting a common core
across implementations

The external interface of TISC has 8 distinct input/output ports

IO ACTIVE: boolean output
	Raised when there is an externally mapped address currently selected to support
	memory mapped IO.
	Known internally as the "External Address Select". The default address range
	is 0xFC - 0xFF as memory mapped I/O ports.

IO ENABLE: boolean input
	External components raise this line to signal that the external INPUT line can be used

WRITE ACTIVE: boolean output
	Raised when there is a write operation for the selected external component.

INPUT: 8-bit input bus
	This is the 8-bit bus for incoming data from outside of the TISC core

OUTPUT: 8-bit output bus
	This is the 8-bit bus for outgoing data routed to outside of the TISC core

ADDRESS: 8-bit output bus
	The current 8-bit program counter value, used to signal for external memory mapped IO

CLOCK: sync. signal
	core clock line

RESET: sync. signal
	reset core
